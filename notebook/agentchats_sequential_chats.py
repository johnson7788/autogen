# # Solving Multiple Tasks in a Sequence of Chats with Different Conversable Agent Pairs
# 
# This notebook showcases how to use the new chat interface `autogen.initiate_chats` to solve a set of tasks with a sequence of chats. 
# 
# \:\:\:info Requirements
# 
# Install `pyautogen`:
# ```bash
# pip install pyautogen
# ```
# 
# For more information, please refer to the [installation guide](/docs/installation/).

# ### Example Tasks
# Below are three example tasks, with each task being a string of text describing the request. The completion of later tasks requires or benefits from the results of previous tasks.
# 

# In[2]:


financial_tasks = [
    """What are the current stock prices of NVDA and TESLA, and how is the performance over the past month in terms of percentage change?""",
    """Investigate possible reasons of the stock performance leveraging market news.""",
]

writing_tasks = ["""Develop an engaging blog post using any information provided."""]


# ### Example 1: Solve tasks with a series of chats
# 
# The `autogen.initiate_chats` interface can take a list of dictionaries as inputs. Each dictionary preserves the following fields: 
# 
# - `sender`: a conversable agent as the sender;
# - `recipient`: a conversable agent as the recipient;
# - `message`: is a string of text (typically a message containing the task) or a callable;
# - `summary_method`: A string or a callable to get a summary from the chat. Currently supported choices include `last_msg`, which takes the last message from the chat history as the summary, and `reflection_with_llm`, which uses an LLM call to reflect on the chat history and summarize a takeaway;

# #### Check chat results
# The `initiate_chat` method returns a `ChatResult` object, which is a dataclass object storing information about the chat. Currently, it includes the following attributes:
# 
# - `chat_history`: a list of chat history.
# - `summary`: a string of chat summary. A summary is only available if a summary_method is provided when initiating the chat.
# - `cost`: a tuple of (total_cost, total_actual_cost), where total_cost is a dictionary of cost information, and total_actual_cost is a dictionary of information on the actual incurred cost with cache.
# - `human_input`: a list of strings of human inputs solicited during the chat. (Note that since we are setting `human_input_mode` to `NEVER` in this notebook, this list is always empty.)

# In[5]:


for i, chat_res in enumerate(chat_results):
    print(f"*****{i}th chat*******:")
    print(chat_res.summary)
    print("Human input in the middle:", chat_res.human_input)
    print("Conversation cost: ", chat_res.cost)
    if i == 1:
        assert (
            len(chat_res.chat_history) == 4
        ), f"The chat history should contain at most 4 messages because max_turns is set to 2 in the {i}-th chat."
    print("\n\n")


# ### Example 2: Solve a Sequence of Tasks involving User Defined Message
# 
# In this example, say I have two tasks. One resarch task and a one writing task. The writing task needs data from research task. In this example, we direct read data from a file as part of the message.

# In[2]:


research_task = """What are daily stock prices of NVDA and TESLA in the past month. Save the results in a .md file named 'stock_prices.md'."""

        filename = context.get("work_dir", "") + "/stock_prices.md"

    except Exception as e:
