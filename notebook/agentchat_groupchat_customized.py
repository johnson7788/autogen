# # Group Chat with Customized Speaker Selection Method
# 
# AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent conversation.
# Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).
# 
# In this notebook, we demonstrate how to pass a cumstomized agent selection method to GroupChat. The customized function looks like this:
# 
# ```python
# def custom_speaker_selection_func(last_speaker, groupchat):
#     """Define a customized speaker selection function.
#     A recommended way is to define a transition for each speaker in the groupchat.
# 
#     Parameters:
#         - last_speaker: Agent
#             The last speaker in the group chat.
#         - groupchat: GroupChat
#             The GroupChat object
#     Return:
#         Return one of the following:
#         1. an `Agent` class, it must be one of the agents in the group chat.
#         2. a string from ['auto', 'manual', 'random', 'round_robin'] to select a default method to use.
#         3. None, which indicates the chat should be terminated.
#     """
#     pass
# 
# groupchat = autogen.GroupChat(
#     speaker_selection_method=custom_speaker_selection_func,
#     ...,
# )
# ```
# The last speaker and the groupchat object are passed to the function. Commonly used variables from groupchat are `groupchat.messages` an `groupchat.agents`, which is the message history and the agents in the group chat respectively. You can access other attributes of the groupchat, such as `groupchat.allowed_speaker_transitions_dict` for pre-defined allowed_speaker_transitions_dict.

# ## Construct Agents
# 
# - Planner: Give a plan and revise.
# - Admin: Human in the loop to approve or terminate the process.
# - Engineer: Retrieve papers from the internet by writing code.
# - Executor: Execute the code.
# - Scientist: Read the papers and write a summary.
# 
# The pipeline is the following:
# 
# 1. The planner interact with Admin (user) to revise a plan. Only when the Admin types "Approve", we can move to the next step.
# 2. The engineer will write code to retrieve papers from the internet. The code will be executed by executor.
# 3. When the code is executed successfully, the scientist will read the papers and write a summary.
# 4. The summary will be reviewed by the Admin and give comments. When the Admin types "TERMINATE", the process will be terminated.
